Ping Pong, also known as Table Tennis, is a popular indoor sport that is played on a table divided by a net. The game involves two or four players who use paddles (also called rackets) to hit a lightweight ball back and forth across the table.

Here is some information about Ping Pong:

Objective:
The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball over the net in such a way that the opponent cannot return it successfully. A point is awarded when the opponent fails to return the ball or commits a specific fault.

Gameplay:
- Players stand on opposite sides of the table, each using a paddle to hit the ball.
- The game starts with one player serving the ball by tossing it into the air and striking it diagonally across the net to the opponent's side.
- The receiving player must return the ball before it bounces twice on their side of the table.
- The players continue to hit the ball back and forth, attempting to make it difficult for the opponent to return.
- The ball must clear the net and land on the opponent's side of the table for a valid shot.
- Players must allow the ball to bounce once on their side of the table before returning it (unless it is a smash or volley).
